# Profilesaver
This project was inspired in KeePass project. I know it's not the same but with time I'll do it better.
Advices and collaboration are welcome.

This is a little password manager. it uses a SQLite database to store your favorite sites username and password.
The first time, you need to create a new user in the option "Crear Nuevo Usuario".

Insert your data and now you can log in. Your user password is encrypted with sha2 and for now there is no way to recover accounts, but I'll work hard to do it
